# Option Pricing under Rough Volatility
## Ecole Polytechnique Research Project (Fall 2021)

This project is the result of the collaboration between Mehdi and Joachim for one of our Ecole Polytechnique Research Projects (Fall 2021).

### Description
The goal of this project is to derive some preliminary results about rough volatility models, which are
widely used to model financial markets. It is the result of a three-month research
project by pair, during which we focused on the papers [1] and [2]. For each article, we
successively mathematically analysed the model, and then implemented it in Python.
All in all, this report should help anyone with basic background in stochastic calculus
to understand the main ideas behind rough volatility models and verify them numeri-
cally through the provided Jupyter notebooks.

### Final Report
The final report is available under the ```pdf``` directory.
